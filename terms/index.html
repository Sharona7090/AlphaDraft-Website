  1. Description of Patenteer.
<br>
  Patenteer, Inc. (“Patenteer”) provides an online portal to provide companies an automated software solution for various tasks related to the practice of patent preparation and prosecution. Customer need not download or even license Patenteer software.

Patenteer is not a law firm and may not perform services performed by an attorney. Patenteer and its Services are not substitutes for the advice or services of an attorney.
<br><br>
